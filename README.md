This repo is a bit janky — it started as a personal project, and at some point I decided to turn it into a local repo. Now I've decided to throw it on GitHub.

I'm probably not following most (or any) best practices, but the bulk of the functional work is done, so I’m starting to focus on cleaning things up. Since I have little to no experience, I’d appreciate any feedback I can get.
