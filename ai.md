i do use chatgpt sometimes, i have been trying my best to use it to learn amoung other things, such as making some text better, since i'm not the best at putting ideas to words and can ramble sometimes 

i do not vibe code, i don't copy paste much and try to understand whatever gpt regurgitates at me

so far the main things i've used it for is for learning cpp along with some C# for the extraction scripts , the readme.md to pretty it up. i don't think there is anything beyond that. 
though please, if you have questions or concerns , share them, i can't get better or know that others don't like something if i'm not told.
also been trying to use it less along with using google some more
